 
# The Clock
Create twelve different visual representations of a clock. This is a creative interpretation of the clock, focused on visual quality, aesthetics and inventiveness. Your interpretation needs to be legible to you (the author), and you need to be able to explain how the time is derived visually at any given point. Think about the different states of the clock. How do they represent the time, how does it look in different moments in time?
